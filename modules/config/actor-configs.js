        <p>Once a new Act exists, the Stand can <em>slide</em> between them at will.</p>

        <p>Each Act burns¬†2 <em>Learning Ranks</em>, so a full¬†<em>3-Act</em> Stand must manage its burns.</p>
        <p>Act¬†1 would have an <strong>A</strong> for temporary Learning burns, with Act¬†2 at¬†C and Act¬†3 at¬†E.</p>
        <p>Burning temporary ranks as one Act burns them for all Acts.</p>
        <p>For permanent burns, the latest Act is used.</p>

        <p>If it is a¬†<em>2-Act</em> Stand, Acts¬†1 &¬†2 each have 3/4ths the base point pool, rounded down.</p>
        <p>For a¬†<em>3-Act</em> Stand, each of the Acts has 2/3rds, rounded down.</p>
        <p>Learning & Ability are paid for after the deduction.</p>
        <p>Learning is priced at the new Act‚Äôs grade, and can‚Äôt be increased.</p>

        <p>At a pool of (21P *¬†3/4) = 15P, Act¬†1 has (15P - [4P (B Learning) +¬†3P (Ability)]) =¬†8P left.</p>
        <p>Act¬†2 has (15P - [2P (D Learning) +¬†3P (Ability)]) =¬†10P left.</p>

        <p>The PCs may <em>create</em> the Acts, but the Narrator usually decides their <em>activation</em>.</p>
        <p>Rule of thumb; Act¬†1 in Earlygame, Act¬†2 when starting Midgame, and Act¬†3 Lategame.</p>

        <p>Act¬†4 is rare, due to game-breaking potential.</p>
        <p>Act¬†4 gets 4/3rds of the normal Stand Pool, and only appear in the Endgame.</p>
        <p>Due to the lack of Learning, this Act must be achieved through <em>other means</em>.</p>

        <p>An ancient <em>breathing technique</em>, Hamon is drawn from the User‚Äôs vital energy.</p>
        <p>A Hamon User must maintain a consistent <em>rhythm</em> of breathing to use Hamon.</p>

        <p><em><u>Basic Abilities</u></em></p>
        <p>
          <u>Conduction</u> ‚Äì Hamon travels very well through <em>liquids and organics</em>, like oil or flesh.
          Hamon can have <em>positive/negative</em> charges, to attract or repel in physics-defying ways.
          Users can also <em>infuse</em> objects with this life energy, acting like a charged battery.
          The effects of infusion depend on the User‚Äôs <u>Overdrive</u> and <u>Range</u>.
          Hamon <em>disperses</em> over large areas; small points of contact are strongly <em>concentrated</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Sunlight Sendo</u> (<em>-X Temp Learning</em>) ‚Äì Hamon‚Äôs original usage is tuning the User‚Äôs breath to the frequency of <em>sunlight</em>, to counter Pillar Men and Vampires.
          Actions against the <em>undead</em> get <strong>+1 Advantage</strong> for each Learning rank burnt.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Hamon Healing</u> (<em>-X Temp</em>) ‚Äì <u>Reduces Severity</u> of all physical Hits on the target.
          The reduction is equal to the Learning burnt. If a Hit is scaled down to 0, it is removed.
          As an <em>Action</em>, a Reaction can intervene.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Rhythmic Breathing</u> (<em>Other</em>) ‚Äì <strong>Regain 1 Temp Learning/Round</strong> while breath is focused.
          Situations that <em>disrupt</em> the Hamon Warrior‚Äôs flow will <strong>burn 1 Temp Learning/Round</strong>.
          Ranks decreasing to 0 cuts off <u>all</u> Hamon Abilities (including Stats) until restored.
        </p>

        <p><em><u>Special Ability ‚Äì Overdrives</u></em></p>
        <p>
          <u>Overdrives</u> are unique <em>techniques</em> related in some way to <em>vibrations</em> or <em>wavelength</em>.
          This can range anywhere from sound waves, to water molecules, to string theory.
          Overdrives are the equivalent of a Stand Ability, as are all other ‚ÄòSpecial Abilities‚Äô.
        </p>

        <p><em><u>Stats</u></em></p>
        <p>Stats are the <em>vigor</em> of a User's Hamon & Overdrive, applied directly to them.</p>
        <p><strong>Power</strong> = The potency of Hamon, User‚Äôs <em>strength</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Speed</strong> = The responsiveness of Hamon‚Äôs effects, User‚Äôs <em>agility</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Precision</strong> = The exactness of Hamon‚Äôs output variation, User‚Äôs <em>control</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Durability</strong> = The hardness given to infused objects, User‚Äôs <em>defense</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Range</strong> = The conduction of the Hamon, from flesh-only to steel bars to the intangible.</p>

          Zombies have a Point Pool equal to (<em>Ranks Burnt √ó 4</em>).
          A Flesh Bud can be made instead to preserve a Stand, but can be excised.
          Stands then have their stats reduced to (<em>Ranks Burnt / 5</em>) of their original pool.
        </p>

        <p><em><u>Special Ability ‚Äì Functions</u></em></p>
        <p>
          <u>Functions</u> are a <em>superhuman bodily process</em>, deforming <em>natural biology</em> for gimmicks.

          Devices the User didn‚Äôt make can be used, if they know how it works (cost still applies).
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Kinetic Displacement</u> (<em>‚Äì1 Temp</em>) ‚Äì Shifts kinetic force from one area to another.
          For example, punch a wall to hit the person <em>behind</em> it, or <em>shift</em> an injury‚Äôs location.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Golden Spin</u> (<em>‚ÄìX Temp</em>) ‚Äì Devices harness a <em>mathematical truth</em>, hidden in nature.
          If a <em>replication</em> of it is found, boost a non-Learning Stat equal to ranks burnt, up to <strong>A</strong>.
          This boost lasts until the Device‚Äôs energy or the focus being used are <em>interrupted</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Super Spin</u> (<em>‚ÄìX/1 Perm, min. 1</em>) ‚Äì The perfected form of that Device‚Äôs Golden Spin.
          It is a unique, complicated technique that allows the device to tap into infinity.
          A discounted Permanent burn is made, but it is <em>only</em> usable during Super Spin.
          If used multiple times, a different Super Spin technique must be used for each variant.
        </p>

        <p><em><u>Stats</u></em></p>
        <p>Stats (except Learning) are tied to the Device or improvised medium, not the User.</p>
        <p><strong>Power</strong> = The Device‚Äôs mass and destructiveness.</p>
        <p><strong>Speed</strong> = The Device‚Äôs travel time and velocity.</p>
        <p><strong>Durability</strong> = The Device‚Äôs sturdiness and level of craftsmanship.</p>
        <p><strong>Precision</strong> = The Device‚Äôs maneuverability and control.</p>
        <p><strong>Range</strong> = The Device‚Äôs inertia and ability to maintain Spin in unfavorable conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>Learning</strong> = Vision. Both temporarily and permanently burnt.</p>

        <p><em><u>Armed Phenomenon ‚öô</u></em></p>
        <p>A lifeform infected with a <em>Parasite</em>, gaining power in exchange for a <em>doomed future</em>.</p>

        <p><em><u>Basic Abilities</u></em></p>
        <p>
          <u>Sentient Parasite</u> (<em>-1 Temp</em>) ‚Äì More than just a weapon, they have a mind of their own.
          The Parasite gains User Stats (excluding <em>Luck</em>) with a pool of (<em>Range Ranks √ó 3</em>).
          A host can use the Parasite‚Äôs <em>Stats</em> without Learning burn, but loses control doing so.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Instant Regeneration</u> (<em>-3 Temp</em>) ‚Äì One physical Hit is <em>instantly healed</em>, not an <em>Action</em>.
          Armed Phenomenon still Retire at <strong>0</strong>, but can <em>only</em> die by fire or Hamon, and only at <strong>-2</strong>.
          Parasite death or extraction will kill the Host as well, without exception.
        </p>

        <p><em><u>Special Ability ‚Äì Phenomena</u></em></p>
        <p>
          A <u>Phenomenon</u> is similar to a vampiric <em>Function</em>, biologically based powers.
          Each Phenomenon is added at a specific <em>Stage</em>, which advances with time or plot.
          All Phenomena/Properties are <em>bought in advance at half cost</em> during character creation.
          If the sum is odd, round up for the final cost (ex. 2 + 3 + 6 = 11, 11/2 = 5.5 ‚Üí 6 Points).
        </p>

        <p><u>Stage 1</u> ‚Äì The Parasite <em>awakens</em>. The Host <em>unlocks</em> Phenomenon #1, but appears normal.</p>
        <p><u>Stage 2</u> ‚Äì The Parasite <em>matures</em>. Phenomenon #2 is added, and a <em>Morph</em> form is made.
          This transformation improves the Host‚Äôs body and stats, but also <em>possesses</em> them.
          A condition is needed to <em>trigger</em> the Morph, to use all post‚ÄìStage 1 Phenomena/Stats.
          The canon example of a <em>Morph Property</em> is Ikuro‚Äôs Armored Body.
        </p>
        <p><u>Stage 3</u> ‚Äì The Parasite & Host <em>merge</em>. The Morph is now <em>permanent</em>, no on/off switch.
          Phenomenon #3 emerges. The Host is <em>synchronized</em> and <em>Sentient Parasite</em> has no cost.
        </p>
        <p><u>Stage 4</u> ‚Äì The Parasite is at <em>critical level</em>. It will soon reproduce, and the Host will die.
          What happens during this depends on the Parasite‚Äôs species, and is <em>unknown</em>.
        </p>

        <p><em><u>Stats</u></em></p>
        <p>The enhanced form of the Host. The first four stats are only accessible when <em>morphed</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Power</strong> = The Host‚Äôs strength when transformed.</p>
        <p><strong>Speed</strong> = The Host‚Äôs agility when transformed.</p>
        <p><strong>Durability</strong> = The Host‚Äôs endurance when transformed.</p>
        <p><strong>Precision</strong> = The Host‚Äôs accuracy when transformed.</p>
        <p><strong>Range</strong> = The parasite‚Äôs evolution. Used for their point buy.</p>
        <p><strong>Learning</strong> = The parasite‚Äôs <em>adaptability</em>. Burnt for instant regeneration and adaptation.</p>

      <p><em><u>Special Ability ‚Äì Upgrades</u></em></p>
      <p>
        An <u>Upgrade</u> is an enhancement, adding a tool or property to the Cyborg frame.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Cyborg starts with <em>two Initial Upgrades</em>, each worth up to <strong>3 Points</strong>.
        Cyborgs can have up to <strong>five total Upgrades</strong>, including <em>Experiments</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a Cyborg is <em>Retired</em>, one Upgrade of their choice is <em>permanently broken</em>.<br>
        When a Cyborg dies, all Upgrades <strong>except one</strong> will break.
      </p>

      <p><em><u>Basic Abilities</u></em></p>
      <p>
        <u>Experiment</u> (<em>-3 Temp</em>) ‚Äì Permanently adds a new Upgrade to the Cyborg‚Äôs arsenal.
        The maximum extent of an Experiment is decided by the Cyborg‚Äôs <em>Range</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>Tweak</u> (<em>-2 Temp</em>) ‚Äì Modify an existing Upgrade, increasing its point value by <strong>+1</strong>.
        Tweaks can be burnt twice at once to increase point value by <strong>+2</strong>.
        Any given Upgrade can have a maximum point value of <strong>3</strong>.
        If an Upgrade is already at 3 points, Tweak can modify it into a different 3-point ability.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>Rebuild</u> (<em>-X Perm</em>) ‚Äì When a Cyborg dies, they can be restored better than ever.
        For each <em>permanent rank</em> spent, add <strong>one Experiment or two Tweaks</strong>.
        For each rank spent <em>past the first</em>, gain <strong>one point</strong> to increase a non-Learning Stat.
      </p>

      <p><em><u>Stats</u></em></p>
      <p>The improved <em>prowess</em> of the Cyborg. Applied directly to the User‚Äôs mechanical body.</p>
      <p><strong>Power</strong> = The strength of the Cyborg frame.</p>
      <p><strong>Speed</strong> = The responsiveness of the Cyborg frame.</p>
      <p><strong>Durability</strong> = The reinforcement of the Cyborg frame.</p>
      <p><strong>Precision</strong> = The Cyborg frame‚Äôs accuracy and senses.</p>
      <p><strong>Range</strong> = How advanced the Cyborg‚Äôs Experiments are.</p>
      <p><strong>Learning</strong> = Resources. How quickly a Cyborg can surpass their limits.</p>
