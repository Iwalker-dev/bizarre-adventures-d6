**Use Info**

Hue Shift - Within Lighting controls, click the "Hue Shift Canvas" button to shift the hue 30 degrees. By default, use ctrl+h to reset the hue.
To Be Continued - Click the button to place the animation over all screens, turning off all current music. Create a Scene called Outro and it will automatically switch to it afterwards.
Roller - As a GM, Highlight up to 2 tokens to roll for both. As a user, choose between your owned actors to roll.
Power Sheet - For all non-stand abilities. The type correctly changes the stat names, however doesn't reveal any description yet.
Stand Sheet - For all stand abilities. Type cost is currently broken, but their related blurb is easily visible (unless it is particularly long.). It will become clearer in a future sheet update.
User Sheet - For all user types. Currently, the type is stored in a hard to read box at the bottom of the Bio tab. It will be clearer once it's impact on the sheet is functional.
